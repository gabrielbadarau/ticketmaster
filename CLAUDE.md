# Ticketmaster Clone

A learning project: implementing a Ticketmaster-style ticket booking platform to learn **.NET and system design**, built by a developer with strong JS/TS/React/Node background but new to .NET.

**Learning mode**: explain .NET/C# concepts and system design tradeoffs as we go (analogies to Node/Express are welcome). Don't just hand over finished code without walking through the reasoning — the point of this project is the learning, not just the artifact.

Reference spec: [HelloInterview Ticketmaster breakdown](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/ticketmaster) — functional/non-functional requirements, data model, API design, and the deep dives (booking concurrency, real-time seat updates, search) all come from here unless we deviate deliberately.

## Tech stack

- **.NET 10** — backend, ASP.NET Core Web API
- **PostgreSQL** — primary datastore
- **Redis** — distributed locks (ticket reservations with TTL), caching, virtual waiting-queue (sorted sets)
- **Elasticsearch** — full-text event search (later phase)
- **Stripe** — payment processing
- **React** — frontend, built later once the API works, mainly to exercise it

## Architecture

Microservices (chosen deliberately for system-design learning value, even though it's more upfront plumbing than a monolith):

- **API Gateway** — routing, auth, rate limiting
- **Event Service** — event/venue/performer read model
- **Booking Service** — ticket reservation + purchase flow, Redis distributed locks, Stripe integration
- **Search Service** — event search (Postgres full-text first, Elasticsearch later)

**Data ownership**: one shared PostgreSQL database/schema across all services for now (matches the reference article, keeps focus on .NET + booking concurrency logic first). Database-per-service is a deliberate future refactor, not the starting point — don't split it unprompted.

## Build order

1. **Event Service** — simplest read-only service, get .NET/EF Core basics working end-to-end
2. **Booking Service** — the interesting part: reservation flow, Redis TTL locks, preventing double-booking, Stripe
3. **Search Service** — Postgres full-text → Elasticsearch, CDN/query caching

## Deployment

Local only, no cloud, to keep cost at zero. Postgres/Redis run via Docker Compose once Docker is available locally (fallback: Homebrew services if Docker setup is deferred). Revisit cloud deployment only if explicitly asked.

## Environment status

- .NET 10 SDK: not yet installed on this machine
- Docker: not yet installed on this machine

Check with `dotnet --version` and `docker --version` before assuming either is available.
